## Introduction

This Angular SPA demonstrates the benefits of using **Elf** for reactive state management.
This Angular SPA uses Tailwind CSS, Facades, Presentation components, and View Models to demonstrate the beauty and benefit of SoC in Angular.

## Why a CodeLab?

This CodeLab is the **finishing** point for hands-on coding; where developers leverage their understandings of **Reactive State Management** using Elf + custom Stores/Facades. This 4-hour code jam exercise enables developers to practice implementing those ideas using `concepts-to-practice` lab examples.
